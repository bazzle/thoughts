Today I read Dergigi's article [Bitcoin is Time](https://dergigi.com/2021/01/14/bitcoin-is-time/)

  This article is gold and I learned a lot. It talks about the double-spend problem in digital money.

* How can time be kept in the digital/informational realm? Information does not have time.

* Time seems like quite an abstract concept, what is time? what if all clocks mechanisms failed and counted time differently to eachother, what if an ash cloud impeded our view of the sun and stars, how would we measure the passage of time?
* There can be only two implementations of money — tokens or ledgers.

* Tokens can work as money/medium of exchange in the physical realm, not in the digital/informational realm, because a digital token can be nothing more than a collection of bytes - like a file on your computer!

* A physical object is more-or-less un-copyable, you can't spend the same coin twice in a shop. A digital token is entirely copyable. The act of sending a token to someone else entails copying it first before sending, then trusting the sender deletes the original.

*  **So, digital money must be based on a ledger rather than tokens, but then how to prevent double spend?**

* Well, in a ledger, a ledger being a representation of reality, it's vitally important to make sure the order of transactions is correct.

* Order is defined by time

*  **Who keeps the time in a decentralised system with no central authority?**

* If there is no who, then what / how is time kept?

* And, going back to the informational realm there is no time, there is only information

My understanding with Bitcoin, there is no time in the form of seconds, there is only time in the form of blocks. A new block is found when the hashers (miners) find a number under a specific number defined by the difficulty adjustment. The time (as us humans perceive time) it takes to find a block can vary, but average in every 10 minutes.

## Causality and the arrow of time

There is something about causality... if there's no causality there is no time.

>The concept of the arrow of time, which refers to the asymmetrical nature of time's passage. It suggests that time is fundamentally tied to causality, meaning that events unfold in a sequential manner where one event causes another. Essentially, without causality, there would be no sense of time progressing, as there would be no discernible sequence of events to measure or perceive the passage of time. In simpler terms, the idea is that the direction of time's flow is determined by the cause-and-effect relationships between events.

>From chatGPT

So what??? if there's no events there's no time?

>Essentially, yes. The statement "No causality, no time" suggests that without events or causal relationships between them, there would be no meaningful way to measure or perceive the passage of time. Time is often understood through the succession of events and the cause-and-effect relationships between them. If there were no events or causal connections, there would be no basis for distinguishing one moment from another, and time as we understand it would lose its significance. This concept is integral to many philosophical and scientific discussions about the nature of time.

The article goes on to talk about one-way hashing in bitcoin, and how, I guess that provides causality. The way I see this tying to bitcoin.. In the absence of the concept of time, you need causality. You need something to happen and that to produce effects, or something else to happen?

In bitcoin, there is the process of mining, hashing numbers until the output number is under a specific number, this takes time.

>To keep ledgers and those who manip­u­late them honest, regular, indepen­dent audits are required. The ability to account for every single entry in a ledger is not a luxury. Auditors need to be able to go over the books — backward in time — to keep ledgers honest and functioning. Without reliable timestamps, verifying the internal consis­tency of a ledger is impos­sible. A mecha­nism to estab­lish an unambiguous order is essen­tial.

This is why we say bitcoin is not a blockchain, but a *Timechain*

I continued reading the article, it's gold and I learned a lot. But I stopped when he started talking about Unpredictability

>While causality is essen­tial, it is not suffi­cient. We also need _unpre­dictability_ for time to flow. In the physical realm, we observe natural processes to describe the flow of time. We observe a general increase in entropy and call that the arrow of time. Even though the laws of nature seem to be obliv­ious in regards to the direc­tion of this arrow in most cases, certain things can’t be undone, practi­cally speaking. You can’t unscramble an egg, as they say.

I'm going to get stuck into this another time. For now I'll summarise what I learnt up until this part.

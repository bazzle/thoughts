excerpt: "Thinking about what socialism really is. It's an attempt to level out the living standards, income I guess, between the people who own assets to sell, and the working people who only own themselves to sell in the form of manual labour. The means of production and gains are bought within common ownership. At first money and production will have to be dictated, organised by state."

Thinking about what socialism really is. It's an attempt to level out the living standards, income I guess, between the people who own assets to sell, and the working people who only own themselves to sell in the form of manual labour. The means of production and gains are bought within common ownership. At first money and production will have to be dictated, organised by state.

Aaron Van Wirdum, the Genesis book. Off to a strong start. The first chapter talks about the origins of the Austrian school of economics. Talks about Hayeks early years after WW1. He studied economics at University in VIenna, turns out his professor was Ludwig Von Mises. Very good quote in there, page 14. Talking about Mises criticisms of Marxist socialism.

Carl Menger's school of thought, that the empirical approach of collecting data to predict peoples wants and needs is foolish and will never bear any meaningful fruit. We have to think about economics from first principles, deductive reasoning. **The theory of marginal utility.** - [link to article](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofdiminishingutility.asp)

The previous theory, went along the lines of, something is the value of the raw materials and the cost of labour and factory equipment. Menger argued value is subjective, a pair of shoes would be more valuable to some people more than others, and isn't quantifiable â€“ **Subjective theory of value**

Mises made the groundbreaking argument, and this follows on from the theme of my last entry, under a free market capitalist system, the production of cars in a car factory is dictated by the demand for the cars. The output is valued more than the input, and as a result pay a premium over the production cost. Under a socialist system the production of the cars in a car factory would be under the decree of the state. People value the input more than the output. As a result the factory is not adding value to society.

**This quote hits - If the cars are produced by decree of a central planner, there is no feedback mechanism from society in the form of profit and loss.**

I particularly love the way of describing the free market as the "*Feedback Mechanism*"

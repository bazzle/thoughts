Recently I told a friend I find myself leaning towards **Libertarianism**. What does that mean exactly?

I think of libertarianism as small government, against human interventionism and the belief that the economy, through natural competition between self interested entities, and through the absense of a controlling authority can form spontaneous order which benefits the majority of people.

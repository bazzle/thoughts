<p>So what??? if there&#x27;s no events there&#x27;s no time?</p><blockquote><p>Essentially, yes. The statement &quot;No causality, no time&quot; suggests that without events or causal relationships between them, there would be no meaningful way to measure or perceive the passage of time. Time is often understood through the succession of events and the cause-and-effect relationships between them. If there were no events or causal connections, there would be no basis for distinguishing one moment from another, and time as we understand it would lose its significance. This concept is integral to many philosophical and scientific discussions about the nature of time.</p></blockquote>
